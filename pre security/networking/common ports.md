| Protocol  | Port Number | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| File Transfer Protocol (FTP)  | 21  | This protocol is used by a file-sharing application built on a client-server model, meaning you can download files from a central location.  |
| Secure Shell (SSH)  | 22  | This protocol is used to securely login to systems via a text-based interface for management.  |
| HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP)  | 80  | This protocol powers the World Wide Web (WWW)! Your browser uses this to download text, images and videos of web pages.  |
| HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS)  | 443  | This protocol does the exact same as above; however, securely using encryption.  |
| Server Message Block (SMB)  | 445  | This protocol is similar to the File Transfer Protocol (FTP); however, as well as files, SMB allows you to share devices like printers.  |
| Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)  | 3389  | This protocol is a secure means of logging in to a system using a visual desktop interface (as opposed to the text-based limitations of the SSH protocol).  |
