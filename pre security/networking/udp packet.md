| Header  | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Time to live (TTL)  | This field sets an expiry timer for the packet, so it doesn't clog up your network if it never manages to reach a host or escape! |
| Source Port  | This value is the port opened by the sender to send the TCP packet from. This value is chosen randomly (out of the ports from 0-65535 that aren't already in use at the time).  |
| Destination Port  | This value is the port number that an application or service is running on the remote host (the one receiving data); for example, a webserver running on port 80. Unlike the source port, this value is not chosen at random.  |
| Source IP  | This is the IP address of the device that is sending the packet. |
| Destination IP  | This is the IP address of the device that the packet is destined for.  |
| Data  | This header is where the data, i.e. bytes of a file that is being transmitted, is stored.  |
